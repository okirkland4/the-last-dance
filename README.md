# the-last-dance

In this repository, we have one folder in which contains:

1- Our jupyter notebook with the code we used in out project

2- The data file we used throughout the project 


We wanted to divide up the work amongst ourselves but felt that some parts were harder than others. Instead we would work on the parts of the code that were toughest together to ensure that we were all on the same page and understood what the code was doing. Some contributed more to one part of the project then other parts. Otis, Seth, and James worked more on the regression code. Vincent and Greg had more involvment in the visualization aspect.

But in the ned, we all worked on the presentation together and made sure we were all set up and ready to present our findings to the class.
